## `'static` lifetime

In Rust, the `'static` lifetime denotes that a value or reference can live for the entire duration of the program. When defining a trait object or closure, the `'static` lifetime is often required to ensure that the value can be safely stored and used without causing lifetime issues.

In your specific case, the `F` type parameter in the `LeptosMenu::new` method is a closure that returns a boxed trait object (`Box<dyn IntoView>`). By requiring `F: 'static`, you are ensuring that the closure and any captured variables it uses do not contain non-static references, meaning they do not reference any data that might be deallocated or go out of scope before the closure itself.

This is necessary because `LeptosMenu` stores the closure in a `Box<dyn Fn() -> Box<dyn IntoView>>`, which could be called at any time during the program's execution. Therefore, the closure must not contain any references that could become invalid. The `'static` lifetime ensures that the closure and its environment are self-contained and can live for the duration of the program.

Here's the relevant part of the struct definition again, with some additional explanation:

```rust
pub struct LeptosMenu {
    pub route: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub component: Box<dyn Fn() -> Box<dyn IntoView>>,
}

impl LeptosMenu {
    pub fn new<F>(route: &str, name: &str, component: F) -> Self
    where
        F: Fn() -> Box<dyn IntoView> + 'static, // The 'static lifetime ensures safety
    {
        Self {
            route: route.to_string(),
            name: name.to_string(),
            component: Box::new(component),
        }
    }
}
```

### Why the `'static` Lifetime is Needed:

1. **Boxed Closure**: The `component` field is a boxed closure (`Box<dyn Fn() -> Box<dyn IntoView>>`). This closure could be invoked at any time while the `LeptosMenu` instance exists.
2. **Lifetime Safety**: If the closure captured any references, those references need to be valid for as long as the `LeptosMenu` instance exists. By requiring `F: 'static`, you ensure that the closure does not capture any non-static references, thus preventing potential dangling references.
3. **Self-contained Environment**: The `'static` lifetime guarantees that the closure and any data it captures are self-contained and do not depend on any external, possibly shorter-lived references.

Without the `'static` constraint, you could potentially capture references that don't live long enough, leading to undefined behavior when those references are accessed after they've been invalidated. The `'static` constraint ensures this cannot happen, making the program safer and preventing subtle bugs related to lifetimes.
